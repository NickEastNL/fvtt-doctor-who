An unofficial implementation of Cubicle 7's ***Doctor Who The Roleplaying Game*** for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software. This implementation is targeted specifically at supporting the **second edition** of the roleplaying game.

Please note that this system only provides character sheets and core mechanics to play the game using Foundry VTT. The core rulebook is required to understand the game. No compendiums with pre-existing data are provided. Material provided by supplements, such as characters and equipment, must be entered manually.
